# Portfolio
My web developer portfolio built from scratch using React.

Check it out here: https://www.alessandrobaldassarre.dev 

## Features
This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, information about me, and a contact section for anyone to reach out!

## Tools and Technologies
I used React and TypeScript for this project and regular CSS, no frameworks. I was going to use TailwindCSS but decided
to continue using CSS so I could practice more.

I designed the entire portfolio before actually coding it using Figma. The file can be found in the repository under the design folder.

I used a library called Rough Notation for the highlighter effect on my projects.
